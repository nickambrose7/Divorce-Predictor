## Divorce Prediction Project
In this project, Nick and Killian use various machine learning techniques to predict key indicators of healthy vs. unhealthy marriages based on the data in the following [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/divorce-prediction?resource=download).

## More Information
Please see our [final report](https://github.com/nickambrose7/Divorce-Predictor/blob/main/Final%20Report.pdf) for a deep dive into the insights gained in this project. Curious about how we implemented our custom KNN and K-Means algorithms? Look at [mainReport.ipynb](https://github.com/nickambrose7/Divorce-Predictor/blob/main/mainReport.ipynb); this file contains all the code needed to make this project happen. The rest of the files are miscellaneous- for personal use by Killian or Nick. We thought to keep them for reference later.
